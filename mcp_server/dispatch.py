"""Optional HPC dispatch: run this server's compute kernels on DOE facilities.

Local execution is the default and is untouched by this module. Two modes:

CLIENT-SIDE (hosted deployments — recommended): this server holds NO
credentials. export_dispatch_pack hands the tools/ kernels to the client,
and the client's hep-genesis harness — which owns the facility tokens,
Globus endpoint, project and workdir — stages and submits them itself
(facility-server run_pack_kernel tool / sidecar POST /jobs pack=). A VM
deployment needs nothing beyond this server.

SERVER-SIDE (running the server on your own machine): calling
set_dispatch("polaris"|"perlmutter") routes the compute-heavy tools through
the hep-genesis dispatch engine in THIS process: the tools/ package is
staged to the facility, the kernel runs on a compute node via IRI, and
results come back to this machine. Requirements on this host:
- the hep-genesis backend importable in this environment
  (pip install -e <hep-genesis-agent>/backend[iri])
- facility sign-in (hep-genesis-alcf-auth / -transfer-auth CLIs, or the
  desktop app's HPC panel) — check with the auth_status tool
- a Globus endpoint (Globus Connect Personal) for ALCF staging/fetch-back.
  NERSC needs NO Globus endpoint: with no GCP on this host (or with
  DISPATCH_STAGING=iri) the engine stages up and fetches results back over
  the IRI filesystem API.
Do not use server-side mode on shared/hosted deployments — one identity's
credentials and allocation would serve every client.

State is process-local and read at call time, so an agent can flip sites
per message. Nothing here imports hep_genesis until a remote site is chosen.
